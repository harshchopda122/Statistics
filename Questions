Question 1:
In an email, 5 features are extracted. Let n=20 data are observed from this email. 
(a) What is your proposed model of data? (Hint: you are allowed to choose freely parameters of the model so that the conditions of the proposed model met.)
(b) What is the probability that we observe 2, 1, 0, 0, 17 data respectively from feature one to five?
(c) What is the probability that we observe at most 4 data from the last feature?
(d) Compute the correlation between the first and second features?


Please use R package
(e) Generate 1000 samples from your proposed model in part (a). 
(f)  Find the sample correlation between the first and the second features. 
(g)  Compare the sample and model correlation between these two features.


Question 2:

Use the following information: 
n_1=35,x ̅_1=5,s_1=3,n_2=32,x ̅_2=7,s_2=5 
	Test whether the score variance for the first population is significantly different from that of the second population at the significant level α=0.05, to do so:
	State null and alternative hypotheses.
	Compute the test-value. 
	Find the critical value. 
	Make your decision and explain the reason. 
 
	 Use the result part (a)  for assumption on variance of two populations, test whether the second population mean is greater the first one at the level α=0.05, to do so state, 
	The list of assumptions.
	Null and alternative hypotheses.
	Compute the test-value. 
	Find the critical value. 
	Make your decision and explain the reason.
